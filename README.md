# DrunkAndWalk

A user want to celebrate his holiday. so he has two option to do so. 
one is to take a wine from wine shop.
other is to drink juice from the shop.

In this project, i am traversing his path. How he will go to the shop and will return from the shop.
case 1: if he went for a wine. Then advising him to not drink wine while returning from shop.
        It has been shown that how he will dance on the road.
case 2: If he went for a juice. Then advise him to drink it on buying.
        So he gets some energy and return back to his home asap.
        
The color and background color on the output screen also changes.


This is a fun project. Hope visitors will also like it.
